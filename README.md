# LakbayinApp

LakBayin is an educational tool designed to help users learn and recognize the Baybayin script through quizzes and resources. This application was developed as a capstone project at Don Honorio Ventura State University Porac Campus, and it is based on the lessons from the book "Baybayin Ating Tuklasin!" by Leo Emmanuel Castro.
